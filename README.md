QCA_Router


Reversible logic based Router along with parallel memory design in QCA provides the solution space for Green Computing. 

The basic digital peripheral Demultiplexer, crossbar and parallel to serial converter formulates the Router where as the Decoder, memory array and multiplexer forms the parallel memory architecture.

In addition to that crossings in Router architecture were done in Multilayer Routing are implemented and ratified using QCADesigner tool.
